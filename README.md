## Discussion

Advantages of this scoreboard:

- This scoreboard does not need to be installed, it is straight-forward to run
  via your browser.
- This scoreboard supports a high degree of flexibility through [custom
  configurations](https://bichselb.github.io/judo-scoreboard/scoreboard/#custom),
  such as:
  - Awarding more than one Ippon
  - Configuring whether and when to auto-award Wazari or Ippon during Osaekomi
  - Configuring whether the clock should be stopped on certain events (e.g. upon
    Ippon or upon second Wazari through Osaekomi)
- The implementation is using standard technologies (HTML, Javascript, CSS
  including Bootstrap) and is therefore easy to adapt or extend

Disadvantages of this scoreboard:

- This scoreboard is limited to scoring and tracking ongoing matches; it does
  not include features for managing or scheduling upcoming fights.
